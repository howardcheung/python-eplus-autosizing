# python-eplus-autosizing
This repository stores an example script for copying the autosizing result into a particular E+ building model using Python 3

# Respository structure
* _dat_: store the E+ model and the associated files
* _src_: store the source code to copy the autosizing results from the .eio file to the idf file
* _results_: store the resultant idf file and other verification result files

# Tasks
* to create an example python script that copies one autosized value and create a new idf
* to modify the example script to copy all other values
* to verify the results by comparing the idf files
* to verify the results by comparing the simulation results of the two files
